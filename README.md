Here's a revised version of the description:

Basic code for processing students
This Java program demonstrates basic skills in using Java and SQLite. The program is console-based, with a menu that allows users to make requests from the database by typing into the console.

To start the program, you will need to download the JDBC driver and connect it in your IDE. For visualizing the tables, you can download a database UI such as DBrowser for SQLite.

In the Const class, there is a variable called CONNECTION_STRING located at the top of the code. The directory address is provided as an example, and you will need to change it to be relevant to the directory where you have put the files. After successfully connecting Java with JDBC and updating the variable, you can start the code from the Main class.
