The main idea behind the project is to create a simple program for processing students.
In the first version of the project, it would be added the main logic for the methods,
which will process the students added in. Data will be stored in database, it will be used
SQLite3 for that purpose. So basically it will have the following functionality.

TODO: add method which will show all the tables in DB
TODO: add method for clearing all the data from DB
TODO: check Georgi server/client using db
